# About:
This is my personal project I work on to tackle on different problems in generating random number program and turn into a user-friendly useable application using more on Java Swing. The purpose of this project is practice and improve my thinking towards the specific achievement - a functional application with graphics and easy to use.
# Inspiration:
Random number generator is an essential program in most of people's lives with different unique uses - for small lottery party games, solve the problems of missing dices games, choose people or divide group with random people, etc.. Not only it is to solve daily random number - related problems, it is also used for such purpose as in science, mathematics, and more. As a person who also use them a lot in my daily lives and a Computer Science student, I was inspired and feel the urge of making one for myself and local uses. 
# Softwares:
Eclipse IDE
# What it does:
The application will generate the random number in a user-defined range. The user will enter the number where they want the random range to start with and then enter the number they want for the end of the range. These actions can be done by pressing, interacting with the button interfaces. 
# How it is built:
